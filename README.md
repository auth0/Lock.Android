[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

## Key features

* **Integrates** your Android app with **Auth0**.
* Provides a **beautiful native UI** to log your users in.
* Provides support for **Social Providers** (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), **Enterprise Providers** (AD, LDAP, etc.) and **Username & Password**.
* Passwordless authentication using **SMS** and **Email**.

## Requirements

Android API level 15+ is required in order to use Lock's UI.
If you'll create your own API and just call Auth0 API via the `com.auth0.android:core:1.16.+`, the minimum required API level is 9.

##Install

Lock is available both in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org) and [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). To start using *Lock* add these lines to your `build.gradle` dependencies file:

```gradle
compile 'com.auth0.android:lock:1.16.+'
```

Once it's installed, you'll need to configure LockActivity in your`AndroidManifest.xml`, inside the `application` tag:

```xml
<!--Auth0 Lock-->
<activity
  android:name="com.auth0.lock.LockActivity"
  android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"
  android:screenOrientation="portrait"
  android:launchMode="singleTask">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
    <data android:scheme="a0<INSERT_YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID>" android:host="@string/auth0_domain"/>
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
<meta-data android:name="com.auth0.lock.client-id" android:value="@string/auth0_client_id"/>
<meta-data android:name="com.auth0.lock.domain-url" android:value="@string/auth0_domain"/>
<!--Auth0 Lock End-->
```

> The value `@string/auth0_client_id` is your application's clientID and `@string/auth0_domain` is your tenant's domain in Auth0, both values can be found in your app's settings.
> The final value of `android:scheme` must be in lowercase

Also, you'll need to add *Internet* permission to your application:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

Finally, before you use any Lock functionality you need to configure the Lock instance.
One way to do it would be in your Application subclass (the one that extends from `android.app.Application`), as seen in the following example:

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {

  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    /** Set up Lock */
    LockContext.configureLock(
      new Lock.Builder()
        .loadFromApplication(this)
        /** Other configuration goes here */
        .closable(true)
      );
  }

}
```

> You can check [here](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock-android#lockbuilder) for more configuration options

## Usage

### Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication

`LockActivity` will handle Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication based on your Application's connections enabled in your Auth0's Dashboard.

When a user authenticates successfully, `LockActivity` will send an `Action` using `LocalBroadcastManager` and then finish itself (by calling `finish()`). The activity that is interested in receiving this `Action` (in this case the one that will show Lock) needs to register a listener in the `LocalBroadcastManager`:

```java
// This activity will show Lock
public class HomeActivity extends Activity {

  private LocalBroadcastManager broadcastManager;

  private BroadcastReceiver authenticationReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
      UserProfile profile = intent.getParcelableExtra("profile");
      Token token = intent.getParcelableExtra("token");
      Log.i(TAG, "User " + profile.getName() + " logged in");
    }
  };

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    //Customize your activity

    broadcastManager = LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this);
    broadcastManager.registerReceiver(authenticationReceiver, new IntentFilter(Lock.AUTHENTICATION_ACTION));
  }

  @Override
  protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    broadcastManager.unregisterReceiver(authenticationReceiver);
  }
}
```

Then just start `LockActivity`

```java
Intent lockIntent = new Intent(this, LockActivity.class);
startActivity(lockIntent);
```
And you'll see our native login screen

> By default all social authentication will be done using an external browser, if you want native integration please check [our docs](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock-android/native-social-authentication).

### Passwordless

`LockPasswordlessActivity` authenticates users by sending them an Email or SMS (similar to how WhatsApp authenticates you). In order to be able to authenticate the user, your application must have the SMS/Email connection enabled and configured in your [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/passwordless).

Also, if you would like to use passwordless with *magic links*, please read and follow all the steps mentioned in the [magic link docs](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock-android/passwordless-magic-link).

`LockPasswordlessActivity` is part of the library `lock-passwordless` and you can add it with this line in your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
compile 'com.auth0.android:lock-passwordless:1.16.+'
```

Then in your `AndroidManifest.xml` register the following activities:
```xml
    <!--Auth0 Lock Passwordless-->
    <activity
      android:name="com.auth0.lock.passwordless.LockPasswordlessActivity"
      android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"
      android:label="@string/app_name"
      android:screenOrientation="portrait"
      android:launchMode="singleTask"/>
    <activity android:name="com.auth0.lock.passwordless.CountryCodeActivity" android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"/>
    <!--Auth0 Lock Passwordless End-->
```

Just like `LockActivity`, when a user authenticates successfully, `LockPasswordlessActivity` will send an `Action` using `LocalBroadcastManager` and then finish itself (by calling `finish()`). The activity that is interested in receiving this `Action` (in this case the one that will show Lock) needs to register a listener in the `LocalBroadcastManager`:

```java
// This activity will show Lock
public class HomeActivity extends Activity {
  private LocalBroadcastManager broadcastManager;

  private BroadcastReceiver authenticationReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
      UserProfile profile = intent.getParcelableExtra(Lock.AUTHENTICATION_ACTION_PROFILE_PARAMETER);
      Token token = intent.getParcelableExtra(Lock.AUTHENTICATION_ACTION_TOKEN_PARAMETER);
      Log.i(TAG, "User " + profile.getName() + " logged in");
    }
  };

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    //Customize your activity

    broadcastManager = LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this);
    broadcastManager.registerReceiver(authenticationReceiver, new IntentFilter(Lock.AUTHENTICATION_ACTION));
  }

  @Override
  protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    broadcastManager.unregisterReceiver(authenticationReceiver);
  }
}
```

Then just start `LockPasswordlessActivity` especifying the passwordless type you want to use, so for **Email**

```java
LockPasswordlessActivity.showFrom(MyActivity.this, LockPasswordlessActivity.MODE_EMAIL_CODE);
```

or just for **SMS**

```java
LockPasswordlessActivity.showFrom(MyActivity.this, LockPasswordlessActivity.MODE_SMS_CODE);
```

and you'll see the **SMS** login screen

##Proguard
In the [proguard directory](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.Android/tree/master/proguard) you can find the *Proguard* configuration for Lock and its dependencies.
By default you should at least use the following files:
* `proguard-square-okhttp.pro`
* `proguard-jackson-2.pro`
* `proguard-square-otto.pro`
* `proguard-lock.pro`

and if you use Facebook or Google+ native integration, you'll need `proguard-facebook.pro` and `proguard-google-play-services.pro` respectively.

You specify several files in you application's `build.gradle` like this:

```gradle
buildTypes {
  release {
    minifyEnabled true
    proguardFile '../proguard/proguard-facebook.pro' //facebook native auth
    proguardFile '../proguard/proguard-google-play-services.pro' //G+ native auth
    proguardFile '../proguard/proguard-square-okhttp.pro' //Auth0 core
    proguardFile '../proguard/proguard-jackson-2.pro' //Auth0 core
    proguardFile '../proguard/proguard-square-otto.pro' //Lock
    proguardFile '../proguard/proguard-lock.pro' //Lock
    //Add your app's specific proguard rules
  }  
}
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
