> **Note**
> As part of our ongoing commitment to best security practices, we have rotated the signing keys used to sign previous releases of this SDK. As a result, new patch builds have been released using the new signing key. Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.
>
> While this change won't affect most developers, if you have implemented a dependency signature validation step in your build process, you may notice a warning that past releases can't be verified. This is expected, and a result of the key rotation process. Updating to the latest version will resolve this for you.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Android API Level 21+ & Java version 8 or above is required in order to use Lock's UI.

Here‚Äôs what you need in build.gradle to target Java 8 byte code for the Android and Kotlin plugins respectively.

```groovy
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = '1.8'
    }
}
```

### Installation

Lock is available in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org). To start using *Lock* add this line to the dependencies of your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.auth0.android:lock:3.2.2'
```

## Next Steps

If you haven't done yet, go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and create an Account, it's free! Then create a new [Application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) of type *Native* and add a URL in *Allowed Callback URLs* with the following format:

```
https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/android/{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}/callback
```

The *package name* value required in the Callback URL can be found in your app's `build.gradle` file in the `applicationId` property. Both the *domain* and *client id* values can be found at the top of your Auth0 Application's settings. You're going to use them to setup the SDK. It's good practice to add them to the `strings.xml` file as string resources that you can reference later from the code. This guide will follow that practice.

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="com_auth0_client_id">YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID</string>
    <string name="com_auth0_domain">YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN</string>
</resources>
```

In your `app/build.gradle` file add the **Manifest Placeholders** for the Auth0 Domain and Auth0 Scheme properties, which are going to be used internally by the library to declare the Lock activities and register **intent-filters** that will capture the authentication result.

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 30
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.auth0.samples"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 30
        //...

        //---> Add the next line
        manifestPlaceholders = [auth0Domain: "@string/com_auth0_domain", auth0Scheme: "https"]
        //<---
    }
    //...
}
```

The next step is to create an instance of `Auth0` with your application's information. The easiest way to create it is by using the values defined previously in the `strings.xml` file and passing an Android Context. For this to work, you must have defined the string resources using the same keys as listed above.

```kotlin
val account = Auth0(context)
```

Alternatively, you can directly pass the values.

```kotlin
val account = Auth0("{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}")
```

Or, if you are using _custom domains_ and are required to specify a different URL to fetch the Lock widget configuration from, you can use the constructor that takes 3 parameters:

```kotlin
val account = Auth0("{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}", "{THE_CONFIGURATION_DOMAIN}")
```


### Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication

Initialize **Lock** and handle the release of its resources appropriately after you're done using it. 

```kotlin
// This activity will show Lock
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var lock: Lock

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
        val account = Auth0(this)
        // Instantiate Lock once
        lock = Lock.newBuilder(account, callback)
            // Customize Lock
            .build(this)
    }
    
    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        // Important! Release Lock and its resources
        lock.onDestroy(this)
    }
    
    private val callback = object : AuthenticationCallback() {
        override fun onAuthentication(credentials: Credentials) {
            // Authenticated
        }
        
        override fun onError(error: AuthenticationException) {
            // An exception occurred
        }
    }
}
```

Start `LockActivity` from inside your `Activity`. For this, create a new intent from the Lock instance and launch it.

```kotlin
startActivity(lock.newIntent(this))
```

### Customizing the widget

When using the `Builder` to instantiate the widget, you can pass different options to customize how it will behave. Some options are only available for **Lock** or **PasswordlessLock**. Below you will find a few of them. You can always explore all the available options with your IDE's auto-complete shortcut. Check the Javadocs to understand the default values.


```kotlin
// Create a new builder from Lock or LockPasswordless classes
newBuilder(account, callback)
    // Shared options
    .closable(true) // Allows the widget to be closed with the back button
    .withScope('new-scope') // Changes the scope to be requested on authentication
    .withAudience('my-api') // Changes the audience to be requested on authentication
    .withScheme('myapp') // Changes the scheme part used to generate the Callback URL (more below)
    
    // Lock specific options
    .initialScreen(InitialScreen.SIGN_UP) // Allows to choose the screen to be displayed first 
    .allowLogIn(false) // Disables the Log In screen
    .allowSignUp(false) // Disables the Sign Up screen
    .allowForgotPassword(false) // Disables the Change Password screen
    .setDefaultDatabaseConnection('my-connection') // When multiple are available, select one
    
    // PasswordlessLock specific options
    .useCode(true)  // Requests to receive a OTP that will need to be filled in your android app to authenticate the user
    .useLink(false) // Requests to receive a link that will open your android app to authenticate the user
    .rememberLastLogin(true) // Saves the email or phone number to avoid re-typing it in the future
    
    // Build the instance
    .build(this)
```
